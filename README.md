## Description
Cannabis Collection is a very basic single page web application, that utilizes a Rails API backend with postgresql database and a React/Redux frontend, with room for growth. The app gives the ability to add, edit, and delete experiences one has had with certain strains of marijuana for future reference.

## Installation
To initiate the API, clone this repository, change directories into /cannabis_collection_backend. Run `bundle install`, `rails db:create`, `rails db:migrate`, `rails db:seed` and then `rails s`. Once the Rails server is running, to see the API data, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/strains, http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/types, or http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/effects.

## Use
Once the Rails server is running, from the frontend directory you can run `npm install and npm start` to run the application (when prompted click `y` to run the frontend server on a different port)
